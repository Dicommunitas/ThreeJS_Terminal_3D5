# **App Name**: PetroTerminal 3D

## Core Features:

- 3D Model Display: Interactive 3D Model: Display a 3D model of a petrochemical terminal using Three.js, allowing users to pan, zoom, and rotate the view to inspect various components.
- Component Selection: Component Highlighting: Enable users to select and highlight individual components (e.g., storage tanks, pipelines, loading docks) within the 3D model to view details.
- Data Overlays: Informational Overlays: Overlay information about each component, such as capacity, material, operational status, or maintenance schedule.
- View Controls: Scene Control: Control day/night cycle, weather and view angles to provide varying perspectives of the terminal.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated blue (#4A8FE7) to convey stability, trust, and technological precision.
- Background color: Dark gray (#282C34) to provide a clean backdrop that allows the 3D model and informational overlays to stand out.
- Accent color: Teal (#34B4A3) for interactive elements and highlights, creating a vibrant yet harmonious interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text
- Use crisp, vector-based icons to represent different terminal components, ensuring scalability and clarity.
- Implement a clean, modular layout that allows users to easily navigate the 3D model and access relevant information panels.
- Subtle transitions and animations when selecting components or toggling informational overlays to provide visual feedback without overwhelming the user.
